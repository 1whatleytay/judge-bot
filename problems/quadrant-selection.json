    "general": "A common problem in mathematics is to determine which quadrant a given point lies in. There are four quadrants, numbered from 1 to 4.\n\nFor example, the point \uD835\uDC34, which is at coordinates (12,5) lies in quadrant 1 since both its \uD835\uDC65 and \uD835\uDC66 values are positive, and point \uD835\uDC35 lies in quadrant 2 since its \uD835\uDC65 value is negative and its \uD835\uDC66 value is positive.\n\nYour job is to take a point and determine the quadrant it is in. You can assume that neither of the two coordinates will be 0.",
    "input": "The first line of input contains the integer \uD835\uDC65 (−1000≤\uD835\uDC65≤1000;\uD835\uDC65≠0). The second line of input contains the integer \uD835\uDC66 (−1000≤\uD835\uDC66≤1000;\uD835\uDC66≠0).",
    "output": "Output the quadrant number (1, 2, 3 or 4) for the point (\uD835\uDC65,\uD835\uDC66).",

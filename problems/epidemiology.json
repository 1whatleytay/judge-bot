    "general": "People who study epidemiology use models to analyze the spread of disease. In this problem, we use a simple model.\nWhen a person has a disease, they infect exactly R other people but only on the very next day. No person is infected more than once. We want to determine when a total of more than P people have had the disease.",
    "input": "There are three lines of input. Each line contains one positive integer. The first line contains the value of P. The second line contains N, the number of people who have the disease on Day 0. The third line contains the value of R. Assume that P ≤ 107 and N ≤ P and R ≤ 10.",
    "output": "Output the number of the first day on which the total number of people who have had the disease is greater than P.",
